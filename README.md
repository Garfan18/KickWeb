# KickWeb

This is a Project from a school class called KickWeb. Here we started learning to program with html, css and javascript. We choose an old paper that we turned into a Website. I selected a StarWars themed paper. The class was divided into three sprints, where we worked with different levels of programming. The third sprint is the end product.
