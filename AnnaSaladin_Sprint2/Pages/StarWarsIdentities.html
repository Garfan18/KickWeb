            <h4>Take the Darth Vader illustration. The ultimate master of evil, Vader became a powerful Sith Lord when
                he chose the Dark Side of the Force. At the service of the Emperor, he became an agent of war intent on
                ruling the entire galaxy. “His portrait illustrates this by making him a literal black hole of space in
                the galaxy, and his likeness is made up of spaceships with his ultimate weapon of destruction – the
                Death Star – as his brain,” explains Sophie.
                <p>In the Yoda portrait, we can see how the character’s story plays in the illustration: on Dagobah, his
                    planet of exile, the Jedi master has become one with the Force after his physical existence ends.
                    “His absence is now a spiritual presence in the environment. This translates in the fact that his
                    portrait is made up of empty space,” shares Sophie. </p>
                <p>The Stormtroopers are an interesting subject, considering that they are not distinct, singular
                    characters. “They have strength in numbers, and so the power of one Stormtrooper is represented here
                    by the multitude,” says Sophie. “It’s all for one,” she explains, “and their leader, Darth Vader, is
                    at the centre of it all. Literally. Try to find Vader among the multitude in this portrait. And as a
                    bonus, try to find the intruder, namely a little droid called R2-D2.” </p>
                <p>In fact, all the illustrations created for Star Wars Identities feature hidden secrets. “The C-3PO
                    illustration is one of my favourites because of its intense geekness,” shares Sophie. “Built by
                    Anakin Skywalker, C-3PO is an etiquette and protocol droid who is also fluent in six million forms
                    of communication. Throughout the saga, C-3PO has exhibited a fairly nervous and worry-prone
                    personality and is also known to talk incessantly. He is represented here by his own quotations,
                    taken from all six movies and translated into Aurebesh. Yes, all these symbols are a fictional
                    alphabet of Basic language in the Star Wars universe. How crazy is that? The designers took the time
                    to take Stormtrooper is represented here by the multitude,” says Sophie. “It’s all for one,” she
                    explains, “and their leader, Darth Vader, is at the centre of it all. Literally. Try to find Vader

                    portrait out of that. Nuts!” </p>
                <p>It’s a testament to the strength of the characters created by George Lucas that these heroes and
                    villains still inspire artists today. Sophie believes it’s because they are just like us. Star Wars
                    is about archetypes and (in Jungian terms) the collective unconscious. The story George Lucas set
                    out to tell is the story human beings have been telling for ages. As Joseph Campbell (who is known
                    to have influenced Lucas) explained in his book The Hero with a Thousand Faces, this story is based
                    on a fundamental structure, called the monomyth of the hero: something happens to a young ordinary
                    person which means he then has to go on a quest. Along the way he will meet friends, mentors and
                    obstacles, and he ends up in a final fight with his nemesis (representing Good vs Evil). Through
                    that adventure, he will come of age and find himself.</p>
                <p>“Basically, Star Wars is modern mythology. And that is why these characters are loved the world over
                    and are still relevant today, almost 40 years after their creation. It is amazing to see that the
                    love of Star Wars gets transmitted from one generation to the next – it is very powerful, just like
                    mythology. What I like the most is that you can see in people’s eyes the happiness it brings them,”
                    concludes Sophie, before adding: “That always impresses me. I really love it and feel really lucky
                    to work on such an amazing project.”</p>

                hen the original Star Wars movie burst onto cinema screens almost 40 years ago, nobody could have
                realized just what an impact it and its sequels would have on the lives of so many people. At the heart
                of the story are characters we all fell in love with – but who are they really? This is the question the
                touring exhibition Star Wars Identities aims to discover – and along the way you can discover your own
                true self.
                <p>The exhibition, currently on show in Cologne in Germany, brings together unique art and media from
                    the Star Wars archives. Some of it is commissioned for the show, some of it original narrative art
                    from the Lucasfilm archives. There are over 200 original props, costumes and artworks from all six
                    Star Wars films. </p>
                <p>“Lucasfilm wanted it to be educational and so after a lot of thinking we came up with the idea of
                    exploring the characters, and that is how we ended up exploring the notion of identity,” explains
                    communications director and museum liaison at X3 Productions Sophie Desbiens. “The exhibition
                    basically asks: what makes you, you? We use – in parallel – the evolution of Luke Skywalker and
                    Anakin (Darth Vader), who started off with similar origins and ended up quite differently.” </p>
                <p>The exhibition examines the evolution of the personalities of famous Star Wars characters through
                    their stories. With the help of a scientific committee made up of specialists from neuro-sciences,
                    psychology and genetics, the show organisers defined ten elements that compose someone's identity
                    and applied this to the characters of Star Wars. If you visit, you get the same treatment and have
                    the opportunity to not only look at what makes you who you are but also to create your own Star Wars
                    identity. </p>
                <p>The centrepiece of the show is a set of unique illustrations commissioned on the theme of Star Wars
                    and identity. The creators of these stunning pieces, Jean-François LeBlanc, Sébastien Maheux and
                    Louis Hébert, all work for the organisers' ad agency Bleublancrouge. “Let me tell you,” confides
                    Sophie, “the entire agency's staff fought over who was going to get to work on that project!” </p>
                <p>The idea of the exhibition is to explore what makes people who they are. The challenge for the
                    artists was to render that concept visually. Each illustration explores what makes the character who
                    he/ she/it is, in a manner reminiscent of Arcimboldo's famous portraits composed of fruit and
                    vegetables.</p>
