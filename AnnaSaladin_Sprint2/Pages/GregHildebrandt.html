                ogether with his twin brother Tim, Greg Hildebrandt was commissioned in 1977 to paint the
                original Star Wars film poster. The work was produced for the Jon and Murray ad agency in New
                York, and the two 38-year-old artists were given just four days to paint the poster for a film
                nobody had yet seen or heard of…
                <p>“They called us because of a Young Frankenstein painting that we did for them, in 24 hours, back in
                    1974 for the Mel Brooks film, and the fame we’d gained thanks to our Lord of the Rings art,” Greg
                    recalls. “We went in to the city and discussed the layout they wanted. They gave us some 8x10 photos
                    from the film for reference. Then we went back to my studio and painted non-stop for 36 hours to
                    deliver the job.”</p>
                <p>Could anyone have anticipated then that Star Wars would become so popular? “Of course not,” Greg
                    replies. “No one did.” What’s more, he adds: “The ad agency that had the account had no idea what it
                    was. When I asked what the movie was about, they said they had no idea, they had not seen it. They
                    thought Vader was something like The Man in the Iron Mask.” </p>
                <p>Now, almost 40 years since that poster and 20 years since his last Star Wars illustration, Greg is
                    painting Star Wars again. He’s been commissioned by Marvel to create three new paintings, one for
                    each of the original films, for Omnibus Editions of the original comics. </p>
                <p>“When Marvel first contacted me, I was hesitant. I had not painted Star Wars since 1995. Twenty years
                    is a long time. But as I began to work out sketches, it felt right. I thoroughly enjoyed jumping
                    back into the Star Wars Universe. I tried to challenge myself with each piece and hopefully I
                    succeeded in creating three paintings that the fans will like. </p>
                <p>“Each painting is its own challenge. I try for what I hope is the best composition and the best
                    lighting setup I can come up with. Technical accuracy is important most of the time, [but]
                    especially if it’s a subject like Star Wars. You have to make sure you paint the costumes and the
                    ships as the fans know them, or else you look like an idiot. So of course I went out and bought
                    models of the characters and the ships one more time. Thank God my son, Gregory,</p>
